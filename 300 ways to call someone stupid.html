<li>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.</li>
<li>A couple skittles short of a rainbow.</li>
<li>A few fries short of a happy meal.</li>
<li>A little slow on the uptake.</li>
<li>A little too much chlorine in your gene pool.</li>
<li>A village somewhere is missing their idiot.</li>
<li>About as bright as a 30 watt light bulb.</li>
<li>About as useful as a chocolate fire guard.</li>
<li>About as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle.</li>
<li>About as useful as tits on a bull.</li>
<li>Ahhh, Bless your heart.</li>
<li>Are you a professional idiot, or just a gifted amateur?</li>
<li>Are you lost in thought? It must be new territory.</li>
<li>Are you simple?</li>
<li>As sharp as a box full of marbles.</li>
<li>As useful as a chocolate fire guard/teapot.</li>
<li>At this point, you can only impress me.</li>
<li>Beefwitted</li>
<li>Best part of you ran down the crack of your mommas ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress. I think you've been cheated.</li>
<li>Bless your heart.</li>

<li>He has different talents.</li>
<li>He has garden gnomes in the attic.</li>
<li>He has reached rock bottom, and is showing signs of starting to dig.</li>
<li>He is a modest man with much to be modest about.</li>
<li>He isn’t playing with a full deck of cards, but at least he has all the faces and joker.</li>
<li>He makes decisions unhindered by any knowledge of the facts.</li>
<li>He needs to carry a plant to make up for the oxygen he's wasting.</li>
<li>He sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve them.</li>

<li>I can count your brain cells with my fingers.</li>
<li>I can explain it again, if you'd like, but I cant understand for you.</li>
<li>I could climb your ego, jump to your IQ, and not survive the drop.</li>
<li>I don't know what your problem is, but I bet its hard to pronounce.</li>
<li>I don't want to fight you in a battle of wits, i never attack anyone unarmed. -Henny Youngman.</li>
<li>I envy people who have never met you.</li>
<li>I envy the people who don't know of your existence.</li>
<li>I expected nothing, but I'm still disappointed.</li>
<li>I neither have the time nor the crayons to explain it to you.</li>
<li>I stand uncorrected.</li>
<li>I think we are unable to understand each other.</li>
<li>I underestimated you, but not enough.</li>
<li>I would agree with you but then we would both be wrong.</li>
<li>I wouldn't trust you to sit the right way on the toilet seat!</li>
<li>I'm guessing you weren't burdened with an overabundance of schooling.</li>
<li>I've said in the past that you can try to make something idiot-proof, but then someone will build a better idiot.</li>
<li>If all the idiots in all the villages left their villages and formed their own village of idiots, in that village, you would be the village idiot.</li>
<li>If brains were gasoline you couldn’t power a pissants go-kart around the inside of a Cheerio.</li>
<li>If brains were gunpowder u wouldn’t have enough to blow your nose!</li>
<li>If brains were leather, he wouldn't have enough to saddle a snail.</li>
<li>If brains were leather, you couldn't make a saddle for a June bug.</li>
<li>If he had half a clue, he'd be on the ground playing with it.</li>
<li>If he was any more simple, he'd need watering.</li>
<li>If there was a field with one rock he'd trip on it.</li>
<li>If there was a harder way to do that you two would find it.</li>
<li>If you ever had a clever thought, it died alone and afraid.</li>
<li>If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.</li>
<li>If you had another brain cell it'd be lonely.</li>
<li>If you shoved your brain up an ant’s ass it would rattle around like a bb in a boxcar.</li>
<li>If you were half as smart as you think you are, you’d be twice as smart as you really are.</li>
<li>If you were tall as you are stupid, you could drink from the roof's gutter drainpipe.</li>
<li>If your brain was a car, it would be in reverse.</li>
<li>If your brains were dynamite there wouldn't be enough to blow your hat off.</li>
<li>If your IQ was any lower, you'd trip over it.</li>
<li>If your parents got divorced they would still be related.</li>
<li>Impossible to underestimate.</li>
<li>In French we say: he/she doesn't have electricity at every floor.</li>
<li>In Greece we say: when it was raining brains, you had an umbrella.</li>
<li>In hindi we call people dhakkan which literally means a bottle cap. Meaning empty at top.</li>

<li>In india, we call them tube light because it takes some time for them to switch on.</li>
<li>In Quebec we say: « C’est pas le pogo le plus dégelé de la boite » (Its not the most unfrozen corn dog in the box?).</li>
<li>In russian we say: intelligent thoughts have always followed him, but he was faster.</li>
<li>Intelligence is much like a bank, you’re drowning in debt.</li>
<li>Is there no beginning to your talents?</li>
<li>It could be that the purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others.</li>
<li>It is better to be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.</li>
<li>It must be tough having that learning deficiency.</li>
<li>It's hard to see the big picture when you have such a small screen.</li>
<li>It's impossible to underestimate you.</li>
<li>Just because stupid is free doesn't mean you should abuse it.</li>
<li>Lights are on but no one's home.</li>
<li>Like Forrest Gump, but not as lucky.</li>
<li>Looks like you’re still waiting your turn to use the brain cell.</li>
<li>Makes two short planks look like a fucking computer.</li>
<li>Making a bear-proof trash can is very difficult due to the considerable overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.</li>
<li>More foam than beer.</li>
<li>My days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle.</li>
<li>Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined IQ could go subzero, yet here you are standing right in front of me.</li>
<li>Never mind, I'm sure you're good at something.</li>
<li>Not playing with a full deck.</li>
<li>Not the biggest lint wad in the dryer.</li>
<li>Not the brightest light bulb in the house.</li>
<li>Not the sharpest corn in the turd.</li>
<li>Not the sharpest rock in the drawer.</li>
<li>Not the sharpest spoon in the drawer.</li>
<li>Not the sharpest tool in the shed.</li>
<li>Oh my sweet summer child!</li>
<li>Oh, honey, no…</li>
<li>One oar in the water and rowing in circles.</li>
<li>One screw short of a toolbox.</li>
<li>Please stop wasting my oxygen.</li>
<li>Pumpkin positive - meaning if you shined a light in his ear he's light up like a jack-o'-lantern.</li>
<li>Put his brain in a bird and the bird flies backwards.</li>
<li>Ray Charles coulda seen that.</li>
<li>Sharp as a bag of wet mice. - Foghorn Leghorn</li>
<li>Sharp as a fucking cue ball.</li>
<li>She who laughs last thinks slowest.</li>
<li>Smartest of his siblings.</li>
<li>So dense he bends light.</li>
<li>So let's swing your sack of stupid and see if we can hit some smart.</li>
<li>So which color lead paint was your favorite growing up?</li>
<li>Some people are competent, but this one's very enthusiastic.</li>
<li>Somewhere out there is a tree whose whole job is replacing the oxygen you waste. Find it and apologize.</li>
<li>Son you need lemons to make lemonade and you ain't got no lemons.</li>
<li>Strong like bull, dumb like shit.</li>
<li>Stupidity makes dumb feel better.</li>
<li>Subtle as an air raid.</li>
<li>Sure if there was money in the bed, he'd sleep on the floor.</li>
<li>Thank goodness You're pretty.</li>
<li>That boy could break an anvil with a rubber mallet in a sandpile.</li>
<li>That boy is about as bright as a match in the Sahara - Foghorn Leghorn.</li>

<li>The potential energy only stays potential in this one.</li>
<li>The problem is somewhere between the desk and the chair.</li>
<li>The smartest thing to ever come out of your mouth was a penis.</li>
<li>The stairs don't go all the way to the top.</li>
<li>The wheel's still spinnin' but the hampster's dead.</li>
<li>Their brain in the edge of a razor blade is like a pea in a 4-lane highway.</li>
<li>Their deck is missing a few of the high cards.</li>
<li>There are only two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and i'm not too sure about the universe.</li>
<li>They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.</li>
<li>They haven't got two brain cells to rub together and make a third.</li>
<li>They lock up the bleach where you live, don't they?</li>
<li>They never open their mouths without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge.</li>

<li>They're oatmeal from the neck up.</li>
<li>They're one of the reasons warning labels exist.</li>
<li>They're so narrow minded that when they walk their earrings knock together.</li>
<li>They’re a few pennies short of a dollar.</li>
<li>They’re extension cord doesn’t quite reach the plug.</li>
<li>Thick as 2 short planks.</li>
<li>Thick as a whale omelet.</li>

<li>Well, I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.</li>
<li>Well, not everyone can be as smart as you.</li>
<li>Well, with the way you research facts and incorporate new information into your opinions, I am obviously incapable of changing your mind.</li>
<li>Were you in like… a pretty serious accident?</li>
<li>What you don't know could fill a warehouse.</li>
<li>When stupidity was distributed, he came back for seconds.</li>
<li>When you are dumb you got to be tough, and son you are one tough bastard.</li>
<li>Who ties your shoes in the morning?</li>
